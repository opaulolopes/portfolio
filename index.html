            <h1>Let me automate that task your team work on so repetitively (and probably tediously)!</h1>
            <p>I'm an ex-Environmental and Sanitary Engineer who's been entwined with programming ever since I can
                remember. I did tried to escape it, only to end up returning back to it. It's like Shakespeare said:
            <blockquote>"Journeys end at lovers' meeting"</blockquote>
            <p>Well, at least now I'm a lover with an undergraduate degree. In Engineering, I'd constantly find myself
                automating stuff that other people seemed to spend hours or days doing manually.</p>
            <p>After graduation and a hell of an identity crisis that lasted for almost a year (my Not-So-Great Gap
                Year), I finally gave in and started self-teaching, and finally understood programming was what I was
                meant to study and work on
                during my ride on Earth. I've been pulling out all the stops even since. I try to code almost everyday
                and I'm definitely a better developer today than I was yesterday. That's a daily fact!</p>
            <p>I'm currently looking for a role where I can feel challenged and improve my soft and hard skills, as well
                as being part of a team that inspires me.</p>
