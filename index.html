                    <p>I'm an ex-Environmental and Sanitary Engineer who's been entwined with programming ever since I
                        can
                        remember. I did tried to escape it, only to end up returning back to it. It's like Shakespeare
                        said:
                    <blockquote>"Journeys end at lovers' meeting"</blockquote>
                    <p>Well, at least now I'm a lover with an undergraduate degree. In Engineering, I'd constantly find
                        myself
                        automating stuff that other people seemed to spend hours or days doing manually.</p>
                    <p>After graduation and a hell of an identity crisis that lasted for almost a year (my Not-So-Great
                        Gap
                        Year), I finally gave in and started self-teaching, and finally understood programming was what
                        I
                        was
                        meant to study and work on
                        during my ride on Earth. I've been pulling out all the stops even since. I try to code almost
                        everyday
                        and I'm definitely a better developer today than I was yesterday. That's a daily fact!</p>
                    <p>I'm currently looking for a role where I can feel challenged and improve my soft and hard skills,
                        as
                        well
                        as being part of a team that inspires me.</p>
